# Lightweight React Template for KAVIA

This project provides a minimal React template with a clean, modern UI and minimal dependencies.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: No heavy UI frameworks - uses only vanilla CSS and React
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with KAVIA brand styling
- **Fast**: Minimal dependencies for quick loading times
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and modify

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Customization

### Colors

The main brand colors are defined as CSS variables in `src/App.css`:

```css
:root {
  --kavia-orange: #E87A41;
  --kavia-dark: #1A1A1A;
  --text-color: #ffffff;
  --text-secondary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
  --border-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
}
```

### Components

This template uses pure HTML/CSS components instead of a UI framework. You can find component styles in `src/App.css`. 

Common components include:
- Buttons (`.btn`, `.btn-large`)
- Container (`.container`)
- Navigation (`.navbar`)
- Typography (`.title`, `.subtitle`, `.description`)

## DT3 Site Pages & Routing

This frontend is a small single-page app (SPA) with client-side routing:

- `/` Home
- `/about` About
- `/contact` Contact

Routing is implemented with `react-router-dom`.

## Contact Form: Backend vs Mailto Fallback

The Contact page supports two modes:

### 1) Backend configured (recommended)

If either environment variable is set, the form will POST JSON to:

- `POST ${REACT_APP_API_BASE}/contact` or
- `POST ${REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL}/contact`

**Env vars (either one works):**
- `REACT_APP_API_BASE`
- `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL`

Payload:

```json
{ "name": "string", "email": "string", "message": "string" }
```

### 2) Backend not configured

If no backend URL env var is provided, the submit button is disabled and the UI offers an **Email instead** button using a `mailto:` link with prefilled subject/body.
